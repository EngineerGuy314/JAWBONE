**JAWBONE = Just Another WSPR Beacon Of Noisy Electronics**

Custom PCB and software for a very light RP2040 based WSPR Beacon intended for tracking high altitude superpressure balloons (aka Pico Balloons).

This is an evolution of my  [pico-WSPRer](https://github.com/EngineerGuy314/pico-WSPRer) project. It is very similar except JAWBONE uses the MS5351 clock generator chip instead of abusing the RP2040's internal PLL oscillator. Also, this project is only intended to be used with a custom PCB, there is no longer an option to assemble it from a RaspberryPi Pico and external components (it is probably still possible, but not tested or documented).
